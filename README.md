# Component Database (CDB) — Django Implementation

A Django implementation of the Component Database described in *The Component
Database User Guide* (Argonne National Laboratory / ePIC). The CDB is the
central repository for documenting, organizing, and tracking components used
in a particle physics accelerator or detector project.

## Overview

The CDB captures three interrelated domains:

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Component Catalog** | Reference library of every component *type* — custom-fabricated or commercial — with metadata, drawings, vendors, and properties. |
| **Component Inventory** | Physical instances of catalog items, each with a unique tag, tracked to a specific room, cabinet, or shelf at a specific institution. |
| **Design Library** | Bill-of-Materials groupings: named assemblies of components and sub-assemblies, with hierarchical nesting and installed-instance tracking. |

A flexible **Properties** system attaches arbitrary typed metadata to any
domain item. A unified **Log** system records maintenance, inspection, and
lifecycle events across all domains.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, Django 4.x or 5.x.

```bash
pip install django

cd cdb_project

# Apply all migrations (creates db.sqlite3):
python manage.py migrate

# Load sample ePIC detector data:
python manage.py seed_cdb

# Start the development server:
python manage.py runserver

# Open the admin interface:
#   http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
#   Username: admin   Password: admin
```

To use the Python client from the Django shell:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from cdb_client import CDBClient
client = CDBClient()

# Find where a component is located
client.where_is("000-001-003")

# Get a full Bill of Materials
client.designs.bom("ePIC Tracking System")
```

## Data Model

### Institutions and Locations

**`Institution`** is the top-level geographic anchor, representing a
collaborating lab or facility (e.g. BNL, CERN, Fermilab). Every location
must belong to an institution, enabling inventory tracking across multiple
sites.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Full name (unique) |
| `abbreviation` | Short code, e.g. `BNL` |
| `country` / `city` | Site geography |
| `url` | Homepage |

**`Location`** represents a physical place within an institution, organized
in a self-referential hierarchy: Building → Room → Cabinet → Shelf.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Location name |
| `location_type` | `building`, `room`, `cabinet`, `shelf`, `other` |
| `institution` | FK to owning Institution |
| `parent` | FK to parent Location (self-referential) |

`Location.__str__()` returns the full slash-separated path, e.g.:
`BNL / Building 510 / Room 382`.

---

### Domain 1 — Component Catalog

**`Component`** — one entry per unique component *type*.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique within a project |
| `model_number` | Vendor or internal model number |
| `description` | Free-text description |
| `project` | e.g. `ePIC` |
| `technical_system` | FK → `TechnicalSystem` (e.g. Tracking, Calorimetry) |
| `sources` | M2M → `Source` via `ComponentSource` |
| *(OwnedModel)* | Ownership + timestamps |

**`TechnicalSystem`** — engineering subsystem (Tracking, Vacuum, Controls, …).
Acts as a chapter in the catalog.

**`Source`** — vendor or manufacturer. The `ComponentSource` through-table
adds `part_number`, `cost`, and `role` (`vendor` / `manufacturer` / `both`).

---

### Domain 2 — Component Inventory

**`ComponentInstance`** — one row per physical item.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tag` | Human-readable label |
| `serial_number` | Vendor serial number |
| `component` | FK → `Component` (catalog type) |
| `location` | FK → `Location` (where it currently is) |
| *(OwnedModel)* | Ownership + timestamps |

Each instance inherits all catalog-level properties from its parent
Component, and may additionally carry its own instance-specific properties
(e.g. an inspection report, a QA grade, a date put in service).

---

### Domain 3 — Designs

**`Design`** — a named assembly that fulfils a functional requirement.
Examples: *ePIC SVT Layer 1 Module*, *ePIC DAQ MicroTCA Crate*.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique design name |
| `description` | Functional description |
| `project` | e.g. `ePIC` |
| *(OwnedModel)* | Ownership + timestamps |

**`DesignElement`** — one slot within a design.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `element_name` | Unique name within the design (from naming convention) |
| `component` | FK → `Component` (leaf element) |
| `child_design` | FK → `Design` (sub-assembly — enables unlimited nesting) |
| `installed_instance` | FK → `ComponentInstance` (which physical item occupies this slot) |
| `quantity` | Number of this element required |

Exactly one of `component` or `child_design` is set per element. The
`installed_instance` field tracks which specific inventory item is currently
installed at each slot.

---

### Cross-Domain: Properties and Logs

**`PropertyValue`** — flexible key/value metadata attachable to any domain
item. A single table serves all four targets via optional FK columns.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `property_type` | FK → `PropertyType` (predefined, admin-extensible) |
| `tag` | Optional label for this value |
| `value` | String value |
| `units` | Optional unit string |
| `is_dynamic` | True if value varies per instance (e.g. an inspection result) |
| `component` / `component_instance` / `design` / `design_element` | Target FK — exactly one is set |

**`PropertyType`** defines the schema for a property. The `handler` field
specifies typed behaviour:

| Handler | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `pdmlink` | Integrates with PDMLink engineering drawing system |
| `traveler_template` | Links to an eTraveler inspection template |
| `traveler_instance` | Links to a filled-out eTraveler form |
| `document` | Attach any file |
| `image` | Attach a viewable image (shown in gallery) |
| `http_link` | Store a URL |
| `currency` | Numeric value with `#.##` formatting |
| `boolean` | True/false checkbox |
| `date` | Date picker |

**`LogEntry`** — lifecycle event log, attachable to Component,
ComponentInstance, or Design.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `topic` | `installation`, `maintenance`, `inspection`, `repair`, `decommission`, `other` |
| `entry` | Free-text log message |
| `attachment` | Optional file upload |
| `logged_by` | FK → Django User |
| `timestamp` | Auto-set on creation |

---

### Ownership

Every domain model (Component, ComponentInstance, Design) inherits from the
abstract `OwnedModel`, which supplies:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `owner_user` | Individual owner (Django User) |
| `owner_group` | Owning group (CDB `Group`) |
| `group_writeable` | Whether group members can edit |
| `created_by` / `created_on` | Creation audit trail |
| `modified_by` / `modified_on` | Modification audit trail |

**`Group`** — a named team or department (e.g. `DIAG`, `CTL`, `EPIC_TRK`).

---

## Django Admin

The admin interface at `/admin/` provides full CRUD access to all models,
mirroring the CDB portal's layout:

- **Institution** pages include an inline table of all their locations.
- **Component** pages include inline tables for sources, properties,
  inventory instances, and log entries.
- **ComponentInstance** pages include inline properties and logs, plus an
  Institution column in the list view for quick site identification.
- **Design** pages include inline design elements, properties, and logs.
- **DesignElement** pages include inline element-level properties.
- All list views support filtering and search.

---

## Python Client (`cdb_client.py`)

A standalone query client that wraps Django ORM calls behind a clean API.
All methods return lazy Django QuerySets (chainable) unless documented as
returning a plain dict or list.

### Setup outside the Django shell

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.insert(0, "/path/to/cdb_project")
os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "cdb_project.settings"
import django; django.setup()

from cdb_client import CDBClient
client = CDBClient()
```

# All locations at an institution
lc.locations_at_institution("CERN")

# Buildings only, optionally filtered by institution
lc.buildings(institution_abbr="BNL")

# Rooms within a named building
lc.rooms_in_building("Building 510", institution_abbr="BNL")

# Full nested tree as a list of dicts
lc.location_tree("BNL")
# Returns: [{"id": 1, "name": "Building 510", "type": "building",

# Related data
cc.sources_for("ePIC SVT Silicon Strip Sensor")    # → QuerySet[ComponentSource]
cc.properties_for("ePIC SVT Silicon Strip Sensor") # → QuerySet[PropertyValue]
cc.logs_for("ePIC SVT Silicon Strip Sensor")       # → QuerySet[LogEntry]
cc.instance_count("ePIC SVT Silicon Strip Sensor") # → int

# Full plain-dict summary
cc.summary("ePIC SVT Silicon Strip Sensor")
# Returns: {"id": ..., "name": ..., "sources": [...], "properties": [...], ...}
```

---

### InventoryClient

```python
ic = client.inventory

# Look up a single instance by its primary key (UUID)

## Seed Data

`python manage.py seed_cdb` loads a realistic ePIC detector dataset:

| Object | Count | Examples |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Institutions | 4 | BNL, CERN, FNAL, ANL |
| Locations | 8 | Building 510/Room 382 (BNL), Clean Room (CERN), MP9/Assembly Bay (FNAL) |
| Groups | 6 | EPIC_TRK, EPIC_CAL, CTL, DIAG, MED, APSU_VAC |
| Components | 8 | SVT Strip Sensor, MAPS Pixel Sensor, PbWO₄ Crystal, SiPM, HV Module, … |
| Instances | 8 | Spread across BNL, CERN, and FNAL |
| Designs | 4 | SVT Layer 1 Module, EMCal Cell, DAQ Crate, full Tracking System |
| Property Types | 13 | Strip Pitch, QA Level, QA Inspection Report, PDMLink Drawing, … |
| Sources | 5 | Hamamatsu, CAEN, Concurrent Technologies, Fermilab In-house, … |

The seed command is idempotent — running it multiple times will not create
duplicate records.

Default superuser: **admin / admin**.

## Design Decisions

**`OwnedModel` abstract base** — every domain model inherits a consistent
set of ownership (`owner_user`, `owner_group`, `group_writeable`) and audit
fields (`created_by/on`, `modified_by/on`), matching the CDB User Guide's
ownership model.

**`Institution` as a first-class model** — rather than a free-text field or
a special location type, `Institution` is its own model with country, city,
and URL. Every `Location` has a mandatory FK to an `Institution`, enabling
`SELECT … WHERE location__institution__abbreviation = 'CERN'` style queries
across the whole inventory.

**Single `PropertyValue` table** — four nullable FK columns (`component`,
`component_instance`, `design`, `design_element`) let one table serve all
domains with no duplication of schema, matching the CDB's philosophy that
any object can carry any property.

**`DesignElement` dual-target pattern** — each element sets either
`component` (leaf) or `child_design` (sub-assembly), never both. This
enables unlimited BOM nesting depth and is the mechanism by which a "full
tracking system" design can reference "SVT Layer 1 Module" sub-designs,
which in turn reference individual sensor and ASIC components.

**QuerySet-returning client methods** — `CatalogClient`, `InventoryClient`,
and `DesignClient` return lazy Django QuerySets wherever possible. Callers
can chain additional filters, annotations, or `values()` calls without
re-querying the database. Methods that return dicts or lists are explicitly
documented as such.

## Note for testers/developers

To completely reset the database, use these commands:
```bash
# from your project root (where manage.py lives)
rm -f db.sqlite3
rm -rf cdb/migrations
python manage.py makemigrations cdb
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_cdb
```

## Logging 

Log entries are stored in a single LogEntry table, same table regardless of what the entry is attached to.
Each row has a topic (General/Installation/Maintenance/Inspection/Repair/Decommission/Other), free-text entry,
an optional attachment file (log_attachments/ under MEDIA_ROOT), who logged it, and a timestamp — and it links
to exactly one of component, component_instance, or design via nullable foreign keys, all CASCADE, so deleting
a Component/Instance/Design deletes its logs too.

There's a /logs/ page (log_list) that browses and filters all of them, and each Component/Instance/Design detai
page shows its own logs via the reverse related_name="log_entries". One thing worth knowing: like Designs,
there's currently no "Add Log Entry" form anywhere in the web UI — log_list is read-only,
so the only way to create one right now is the Django admin or direct ORM/API access.
