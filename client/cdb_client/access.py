"""
access.py — Permission and visibility scoping for the Component Database.

Every domain object that inherits OwnedModel (Component, ComponentInstance,
Design) carries three fields relevant to access control:

    owner_user       FK -> auth.User    (nullable)
    owner_group      FK -> auth.Group   (nullable — Django's built-in Group,
                                          confirmed via `from django.contrib
                                          .auth.models import User, Group`
                                          in cdb/models.py)
    group_writeable  bool               (only meaningful together with owner_group)

POLICY (explicit design decision — tighten if it doesn't match your needs):

  READ  : all authenticated users can read all catalog/inventory/design
          rows. epiCDB is a shared collaboration database spanning many
          institutions, and the schema has no per-row read-privacy flag.
          If you need per-institution or per-group read isolation, add
          the filter in `visible_to()` below — the hook is already wired
          into every domain client's queryset method.

  WRITE : a user may create/modify/delete a row if any of:
            - they are its owner_user
            - they are Django staff/superuser
            - they are a member of owner_group AND group_writeable is True
          A user creating a *new* row may only set owner_user to
          themselves, and owner_group to a Group they actually belong to
          (see resolve_owner_group_for_create). Nothing under caller
          control can assign ownership to someone else — this closes the
          hole in the original CLI's `create-instance --owner <anyone>`.
